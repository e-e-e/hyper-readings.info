    <hr/>
    <p>Reading lists are aesthetic objects that both organise and produce knowledge. They are paths in, through, and between things. Sharing what we read, what we want to read, and what we think other people should read becomes a form of peer to peer education, the propagation of informal and personal canons. <strong>Reading lists become a kind of writing - a writing of reading.</strong></p>
    <p>More and more, reading lists are being used as tools for contesting established patterns in public thinking, but also, importantly, for publicly making sense of our current times. <strong>They are becoming almost like manifestos, or provocations for the future.</strong></p>
    <p>HyperReadings is a distributed archival infrastructure for writing, sharing, navigating and adapting ‘reading lists’. Where a ‘reading’ is anything that can be read, this includes texts, images, films, digital and non-digital objects.</p>
    <p>As open source software, HyperReadings is being developed and maintained by Sean Dockray and Benjamin Forster.</p>
